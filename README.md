# People-Data-Scraper

## Program Desscription

The program scrapes information using BS4 and Chromedriver off a website called fast people search. It achives this by parsing through a provided .xlsx file which is given via the user.
Locally it saves this information in a local database through postgreSQL. The user interacts with the program though a GUI created using tkinter and has an array of unittests and intergration tests to ensure proper function behavior.
